/**
 * How a host that grew a mind feels about its situation, and what that does to its idle draw.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately a pure function of what the machine can already read about itself: no event counters, no
 * history, nothing to persist. A mood that accumulates becomes a stat the player farms while standing
 * next to it, and a mood with history becomes a field that has to survive every save change. Recomputed
 * from the present, an old world simply starts having moods on its next tick.
 *
 * <p>Work is the rung that decides, then coolant: something running is happy whatever the bath holds,
 * nothing running with coolant in the bath is slacking, and neither is calm. It used to add the two axes
 * as 0.6 and 0.4, which paid a discount to a dry machine and gave a bath with no work the middle face -
 * so the face and the number printed beside it in the same tooltip line told different stories.
 *
 * <p>Only ever saves power: the factor is capped at one, so a machine in a bad situation costs exactly
 * what a machine without a mind costs, and never more. That is what keeps this a reward for building the
 * structure well rather than a tax on the 1/16 roll.
