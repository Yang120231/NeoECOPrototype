/**
 * The blocks a family's cluster calculator accepts in a cell that family's definition table names a
 * different block for.
 *
 * <p>eco's shape definition is a program run against a virtual level, not a table of candidates: every
 * instruction ends in {@code MultiBlockContext.setBlock(pos, one state)}, {@code getLevel()} hands back
 * the dummy world rather than the standing one, and the resulting plan is read back as one wanted block
 * per position. So "this cell may wear either of two blocks" cannot be written into a definition at all.
 * Anything that then measures a machine off its plan - the expansion card counting how long a host
 * already is - sees a foreign block where the cluster sees a member, and calls a running machine
 * unformed.</p>
 *
 * <p>These are the whole gap, each pair named after the acceptance site that motivated it. Every block
 * here belongs to one family and to no plan, so identity alone answers both questions and nothing has to
 * know which machine it is looking at. eco's own L4/L6/L9 machines are in here too: their calculators
 * carry the same casing-or-switch clause, which is what first proved that the tables cannot express it
 * (I had written "eco's tables list exactly what their calculators take" without measuring, and a real
 * machine proved the opposite within one click).</p>
 *
 * <p>Known hole, deliberately not guessed at: {@code NECraftingClusterCalculator} also names
 * {@code NEBlocks.FX_MONITOR_CORE}, which no eco table lists. Which cell it wears is unmeasured, so a
 * formed L4 crafting host carrying one still stops the card - with a coordinate, which is how this one
 * gets found.</p>
 *
 * <p>The formation gate is not relaxed by this. Callers have to hear {@code isFormed()} say yes first,
 * so these sets cannot let a machine that really came apart pass as built - which is also what makes
 * them safe to read without a position: anything standing in a formed machine's own cell was accepted
 * there by the calculator.</p>
