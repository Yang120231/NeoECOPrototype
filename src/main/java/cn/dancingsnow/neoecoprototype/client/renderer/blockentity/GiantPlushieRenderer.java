/**
 * The giant plushie: one block, three times her size, standing with her feet on the block she was set down
 * on. The block itself carries no geometry - it is {@code INVISIBLE} - and this draws the plain doll's own
 * baked model over it, so there is exactly one copy of her artwork in the jar and a redraw of the plushie
 * shows up here the same frame it shows up on the shelf.
 *
 * <p>She is drawn through the plain doll's block state rather than her own, and turned the same way she was
 * set down: the doll's blockstate names the four {@code facing} turns, so asking for that state's model
 * already gives the model rotated, and the giant's own state is {@code INVISIBLE} - which
 * {@code BlockRenderDispatcher#renderSingleBlock} refuses to draw at all.</p>
