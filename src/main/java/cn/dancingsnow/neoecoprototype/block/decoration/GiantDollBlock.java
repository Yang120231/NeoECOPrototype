 * The plushie drawn three times her size, standing on the one block she was set down on.
 *
 * <p>She draws nothing herself: the client renderer scales the plain doll's model up over this cell, which
 * keeps her artwork a single file - a redraw of the plushie lands here in the same frame it lands on the
 * shelf. Everything else about her is the doll's own behaviour, inherited: she turns to face whoever sets
 * her down and creepers keep their distance.</p>
